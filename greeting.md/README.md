Hello There!

# I hope this works and looks well.
## I was a little confused, but I caught on.
### Hopefully this exercise shows that and where my mistakes are.

I'm not sure **what** confused me, but I personally think that it was 
the fact I am so _young_ in the class. It makes me feel like I am 
automatically expected to instantly grasp this knowledge faster than everyone else.

I know I will:
*Learn
*Conquerer
*And thrive 
in coding, I just have to come out of my shell more.
